Our client is a credit card company. They have brought us a dataset that includes some demographics and recent financial data (the past six months) for a sample of 30,000 of their account holders.

Our task was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the Data, derive valuable insights from the data and build a machine learning model that can predict whether the customer will default next month or not.
